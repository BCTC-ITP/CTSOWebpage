					<h1>FFA</h1>
					<p><img src="Pictures/FFALogo.png" alt="FFA Icon" style="width:79px;height:100px;"> </p>
					
					<p>There are more than three-hundred distinct careers in the agriculture, food and natural resources industries. Agricultural Education and the National FFA </p>
					<p>Organization work in tandem to connect our members to those career opportunities through the Three Circle Model of Ag Education. Our model combines the </p>
					<p>strengths of classroom education, work-based experiential learning and career preparation and leadership through FFA.</p>
					
					<br>				
					<p>Every FFA memberâ€™s journey is rooted in an agricultural education classroom. They are encouraged to apply what they learn in the classroom in a work or </p>
					<p>research-based Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE). As they progress, they have opportunities to test their skills and knowledge against other members </p>
					<p>locally, at the state level and at the National FFA Convention & Expo.</p>
					<br>
					<p>As a student-led organization, members have opportunities throughout their FFA experience to develop leadership skills. They can become chapter officers, </p>
					<p>section or region officers, state officers and perhaps even a National FFA Officer. National FFA provides leadership training for members at all levels.</p>
					<br>				
					<p>Our vision is to Grow the next generation of leaders who will change the world. And we realize that vision by executing on our mission to make a positive </p>
					<p>difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth and career success.</p>
