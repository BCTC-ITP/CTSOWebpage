					<h1>HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America)</h1>
					<img src="Pictures/HOSALogo.png" alt="HOSA Icon" style="width:255px;height:100px;">
					
					
					<p>HOSA-Future Health Professionals is a national student organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Health Science Education </p>
					<p>Division of ACTE. HOSA’s two-fold mission is to promote career opportunities in the health care industry and to enhance the delivery of quality health</p>
					<p>care to all people. HOSA’s goal is to encourage all health occupations instructors and students to join and be actively involved in the HSE-HOSA </p>
					<p>Partnership.</p>
					<br>
					<p>HOSA provides a unique program of leadership development, motivation, and recognition exclusively for secondary, postsecondary, adult, and collegiate </p>
					<p>students enrolled in HSE programs. HOSA is 100% health care!</p>
					<br>
					<p>Since its inception in 1976, HOSA has grown steadily reaching over 165,000 members through 47 chartered HOSA State Associations, Puerto Rico, Washington, </p>
					<p>DC and Italy. HOSA has over 3,700 secondary and postsecondary/collegiate chapters in 2013-2014.</p>
					<br>
					<p>HOSA is not a club to which a few students in school join. Rather, HOSA is a powerful instructional tool that works best when it is integrated into the </p>
					<p>HSE curriculum and classroom. HSE instructors are committed to the development of the total person. Those who join the HSE-HOSA Partnership recognize the</p> 
					<p>importance of providing students with training far beyond the basic technical skills needed for entry into the health care field. The rapidly changing </p>
					<p>health care system needs dedicated workers who, in addition to their technical skills, are people-oriented and capable of playing a leadership or </p>
					<p>followership role as a member of a health care team.</p>
					<br>
					<p>HOSA’s mission is especially critical when considering the acute shortage of qualified workers for the health care industry. It is essential that the </p>
					<p>HSE-HOSA Partnership maintain its momentum and encourage all HSE instructors to integrate HOSA into their curriculum and classrooms.</p>
